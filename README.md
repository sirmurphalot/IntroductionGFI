# **Introduction to Generalized Fiducial Inference** 

For questions, issues, or clarifications please reach out to Murph: <acmurph@unc.edu>.

## Overview

Code implementations of the models discussed in *Introduction to Generalized Fiducial Inference* by A. Murph, J. Hannig, and J. Williams.


This repository is organized into four different directories; one for each of the major models discussed in the paper.  We would expect the two RStan models to be of major interest to researchers (in the directories **RandomEffectsModel** and **MVNModel**) as well as the novel Binomial algorithms.  We have also included all scripts used to make the visuals in the paper if one wishes to replicate them.

## Packages Required

`RStan`, `ggplot2`, `latex2exp`, `ggExtra`, `gridExtra`, `knitr`, `mvtnorm`, `matrixcalc`, `gtools`, `geigen`, `readr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `lmerTest`, `BayesFactor`
