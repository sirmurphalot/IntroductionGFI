Overview
========

Code implementations of the models discussed in *Introduction to Generalized Fiducial Inference* by A. Murph, J. Hannig, and J. Williams.


This repository is organized into four different directories; one for each of the major models discussed in the paper.  We would expect the two RStan models to be of major interest to researchers (in the directories **RandomEffectsModel** and **MVNModel**) as well as the novel Binomial algorithms.  We have also included all scripts used to make the visuals in the paper if one wishes to replicate them.

Packages Required
============

RStan, ggplot2, latex2exp, ggExtra, gridExtra, knitr, mvtnorm, matrixcalc, gtools, geigen, readr, dplyr, tidyr, lmerTest, BayesFactor
